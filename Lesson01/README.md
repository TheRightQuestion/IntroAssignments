# What in the world is a variable? -- (Video Link)[https://youtu.be/EslenxKtZso]

Your assignment this week is to do the following.
* In your repl from last time, are there any parts of it that can be replaced with variables? Remember, variables should be used for things that may change in the future so try and think critically about what should and should not be a variable.
* Try coming up with good variable names and types for each of the following word problems.
```
Floyd is an aspiring music artist. He has a record contract that pays him a base rate of 
$200 a month and an additional $12 for each album that he sells. How much money does he 
make if he sells 12 albums? 100 albums?
```

Wendy wants to make guacamole this weekend. The recipe indicates she needs 3 avocados, 
half an onion, and 1 tomato to make 1 pint of guacamole. Avocados are 7 for $5, onions 
are 75 cents each, and tomatoes are 2 for $1. How much will making 1 quart of guacamole 
cost her? 1 gallon?

* Create a new repl where you can try running some of the problems you wrote. Share your links with others and try to compare variable names you came up with to understand different perspectives.

And remember, everything you need to answer your questions is out there, you just have to ask the right way.
