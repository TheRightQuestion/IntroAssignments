# Coding: The hard way -- [Video Link](https://youtu.be/c8ikA6zw1dI)

Your assignment this week is to do the following.
* Create a google doc where you'll be keeping track of all the repl links you'll be creating.
* Sign up for the [Slack Community](https://forms.gle/Jx3TBiqDFkqB4CEj6)
* Create your first [REPL](http://repl.it)
  * Write some code where you print out some fun facts about yourself.
  * Practice sharing the code. Feel free to post in the #intro's channel on slack to introduce yourself.
  * Something that wasn't mentioned in the video was how to print something on the next line.
The following expression will allow you to do so. Go ahead and give it a try in your examples!
```cpp
std::cout << std::endl;
```

**And remember, everything you need to answer your questions is out there, you just have to ask the right way.**
